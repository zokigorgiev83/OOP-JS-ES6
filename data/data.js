A faint undertone of brown <br> sugar and citrus glides through the whole aroma. Sweet malty <br> caramel and vanilla with the grain whiskey making a bold statement. <br> Light raw woody and dirty citrus notes play about with a bit of dark <br> dustiness coming in right before the finish. Medium and dry with <br> notes of wood, caramel, grain whisky and a sugary sweetness.'

Good body and very creamy <br> with a sublimely malty core. It offers up a surprising <br> level of peat smoke which works really well. Creamy <br> sweetness, hints of soft wood smoke, salty butter, <br> custard and cereal grains. Good length with notes <br> of malt, boiled sweets, black pepper and cool smoke.'

Toasted <br> sesame seeds and basil. Water brings out Indian <br> spices (roasted cumin)."
